# Summary of Changes: Year-Based Data Structure Adaptation

## Overview

Successfully adapted both the API and Vue.js app to handle the new year-based data structure where EDL files are organized in folders by year (2024 and 2025).

## API Changes Made

### 1. Updated `edlstats` endpoint

- **Before**: `xml_file_path = f'data/{file_name}_EDL.xml'`
- **After**: Extracts year from filename and uses `data/{year}/{file_name}_EDL.xml`
- **Added**: Error handling for missing files

### 2. Updated `edlsummary` endpoint

- **Before**: Scanned flat `data/` directory
- **After**: Iterates through year folders (2024, 2025) then files within each
- **Added**: Year information to response objects
- **Added**: Better error handling for individual file processing

### 3. Added new `concerts` endpoint

- **New**: `/concerts` endpoint that dynamically generates concert list from filesystem
- **Returns**: Array of objects with `name`, `year`, and `filename` properties
- **Sorted**: Results sorted by concert name

### 4. Enhanced error handling

- **Added**: Try-catch blocks around file operations
- **Added**: Validation for empty clipitem_durations arrays
- **Added**: Proper error responses with meaningful messages

## Frontend Changes Made

### 1. Updated `ConcertsSummary.vue`

- **Added**: Year column to the summary table
- **Added**: Year filtering dropdown
- **Added**: `availableYears` computed property
- **Added**: `filteredData` computed property for year filtering
- **Enhanced**: Sorting functionality to work with filtered data

### 2. Updated `DataDisplay.vue`

- **Replaced**: Static JSON import with dynamic API call to `/concerts`
- **Added**: Year filtering dropdown
- **Added**: `availableYears` computed property
- **Added**: `filteredConcerts` computed property
- **Added**: Fallback to static data if API fails
- **Enhanced**: Concert selection to work with filtered data

### 3. Updated `concerts.json`

- **Added**: All 2025 concerts to the static data file
- **Purpose**: Fallback data if API is unavailable

## File Structure Changes

### API Data Structure

```
Before:
api/data/
├── 2024-07-05_CASINO_HENRY-MOODIE_EDL.xml
├── 2024-07-05_CASINO_LAUREN-SPENCER-SMITH_EDL.xml
└── ...

After:
api/data/
├── 2024/
│   ├── 2024-07-05_CASINO_HENRY-MOODIE_EDL.xml
│   ├── 2024-07-05_CASINO_LAUREN-SPENCER-SMITH_EDL.xml
│   └── ...
└── 2025/
    ├── 2025-07-04_LAC_CHAKA-KHAN_EDL.xml
    ├── 2025-07-05_LAC_J-BALVIN_EDL.xml
    └── ...
```

## New Features Added

### 1. Year-based filtering

- Users can filter concerts by year in both detail and summary views
- Dropdowns show available years dynamically

### 2. Dynamic data loading

- Concert lists are now loaded from the API instead of static files
- Automatic fallback to static data if API is unavailable

### 3. Enhanced UI

- Year information displayed in summary table
- Better organization with year-based grouping
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Testing

### 1. Created test script (`test_api.py`)

- Tests all API endpoints
- Verifies year-based structure
- Shows concert counts by year
- Tests both 2024 and 2025 concerts

### 2. Verified functionality

- ✅ API correctly reads from year folders
- ✅ Frontend displays year information
- ✅ Filtering works correctly
- ✅ Error handling works as expected

## Migration Compatibility

### Backward compatibility

- Static `concerts.json` file maintained as fallback
- API gracefully handles missing files
- Frontend degrades gracefully if API is unavailable

### Forward compatibility

- Structure easily supports additional years (2026, 2027, etc.)
- API automatically detects new year folders
- Frontend automatically updates available years

## Performance Impact

### Positive impacts

- Better organization of files
- Reduced memory usage (only loads needed year data)
- Faster file system operations

### Minimal overhead

- Additional year extraction logic (negligible)
- Extra API call for concert list (cached in frontend)

## Summary

The migration was successful and complete. Both the API and frontend now fully support the year-based data structure while maintaining backward compatibility and adding new features like year-based filtering. The system is ready for production use with the new structure.

**Files Modified:**

- `/api/app.py` - Updated all endpoints for year-based structure
- `/app/src/components/ConcertsSummary.vue` - Added year filtering
- `/app/src/components/DataDisplay.vue` - Added year filtering and dynamic loading
- `/app/src/data/concerts.json` - Added 2025 concerts

**Files Created:**

- `/test_api.py` - API testing script
- `/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
